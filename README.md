# RoExec Autolauncher
As the name suggests, this program will auto launch ro-exec whenever you launch roblox so you don't have to do it manually :)
This program might contains bugs so if you find any please create issue or you can fix them yourself and then create pull request.

## Usage
**Download the latest version from releases and put the executable into the folder with the ro-exec exe!**

Then simply run the exe and after 6 seconds it will hide itself to the system tray.
To stop the launcher, go into your system tray, right click on the exe icon and click on "Exit", this will stop the auto-launcher!
